                    I am currently working on a team to automate processes and resolutions to drive cost efficiencies within Workforce Digital Services.
                    I worked as operation support for the same organization for several years before being transitioned to my team, Operation Engineering Automation.
                    For resolutions we look to try and fully automate in order to prevent the need for contacting the Service Desk, but when that isn't
                    possible we try and automate the steps the technician or end user would have to follow to remedy the issue.

                    <ul>
                        <li>Created API and Control-M batch job to remove devices from InTune during the destage process and remove duplicate items being 
                            created by devices being restaged without going through the destage process.  This resolved an MII for InTune and cleaned up the state 
                            of devices to resolve issues in ServiceNow Asset inventory.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Implemented additional functionality for already existing automation project for Slack policies to prevent public channels from 
                            being locked down by members of specific AD groups.  Preventing channel owners from not following the spirit of public vs private 
                            channels Slack intended.

                            Worked on several functions and modals within React App for team's Virtual Incriment Planner app.  Overall team delivery moved app off

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Solved process gap for local support by designing a process so that work being requested by other teams not related to Incident Management could
                            be tracked.  Previous method was e-mails with no time being tracked on how much time was being spent to support other teams.  The concept was 
                            intended to associate the time and materials to the budget making the request, but at the time there was no direct billing setup to charge back 
                            other units for work another team did. </li>
                        <li>
                            I was the main point of contact to maintain the equipment deployed to Castastrophe events.  The equipment included mobile devices, the conferencing 
                            equipment, network switch, and satellite system.  I also equipped the workforce that were sent out on deployments.  I deployed to 6 events myself, 
                            mostly to areas hit by hurricanes to offer on site IT support.  While deployed I was able to deliver on the work I was committed to before the deployment.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            I designed and built a room for the equipment to centralize access to it.  Along with trained other employees to perform the same responsibilities 
                            closing a gap on having a single point of failure.  Centralizing the room eliminated an access issue other volunteers had in getting to the laptops, 
                            which where left in the staging room.  It also made it easier to bundle the equipment in the go bags since the other mobile devices where not located 
                            in the same section of the building as the staging room.  The time reduction and incorporating the delivery method into vendable lockers reduced cost of
                            labor.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            I designed, configured, and implemented a virtual walk up help desk. Creating the processes and training for smart lockers and video interface to support 
                            end users without needing a physical presence.  Reducing concerns of spreading Covid and labor of having to coordinate delivery of replacement equipment.  
                            It also opened up the oprotunity to outsource support internationally to reduce labor cost further.

                        <li>
                            I updated SOPs for DeskSide Support to align with Managed Service Agreements and based on tracking work needed to be 
                            performed in person was able to help eliminate positions saving on labor costs.
